**General Information**

This coding challenge intends to to tackle an artistic challenge that combined a passion for art with coding to visually represent human emotions through abstract representations of intangible concepts. I aim to deepen my understanding of human emotion and explore new ways to express it.

**Technologies Used**
- Processing - Version 4

**Features**
- The collation of data through research and previously conducted studies 
- The use of artistic techniques including colour, line and shape
- The similarities of the 3 codes that highlight that they all represent a similar idea
