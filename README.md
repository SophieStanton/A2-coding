**General Information**

This coding challenge intends to to tackle an artistic challenge that combined a passion for art with coding to visually represent human emotions through abstract representations of intangible concepts. I aim to deepen my understanding of human emotion and explore new ways to express it.

**Technologies Used**
- Processing - Version 4

**Features**

- The collation of data through research and previously conducted studies 
- The use of artistic techniques including colour, line and shape
- The similarities of the 3 codes that highlight that they all represent a similar idea

**Usage**

The code is simple to use, have processing ready to go then press the 'run' button

**Project Status**

The project is: complete

**Room for Improvement**

If I was to complete this challenge again I wouldv'e collected my own data using physical coding products which include a pulse sensor and a Microbit. Due to uncontrolable circumstances I was unable to complete this task this time around
